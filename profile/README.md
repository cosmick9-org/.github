# cosmick9-org
This is the organization profile for CosmicK9.net, a website that represents me, Collin Atworth, and my various projects.

## Projects
### [soc.cosmicK9.net](https://soc.cosmick9.net)
This is an Akkoma instance that I run. It is a social network that is similar to Twitter, but it is decentralized and open source. It is also a lot more fun.

### [cosmicK9.net](https://cosmick9.net)
This is my personal website. There isn't anything hosting on the domain yet, but I plan to develop a single-page web app that will tell you all you need to know about me and my hobbies.

## Contact
If you want to contact me, you can do so on my [Akkoma](https://soc.cosmick9.net/cosmick9) account, or you can email me at [collin@cosmick9.net](mailto:collin@cosmick9.net).
